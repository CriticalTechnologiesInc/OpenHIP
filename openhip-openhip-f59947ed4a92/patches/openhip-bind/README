This patch implements the HIP extension to DNS as specified by RFC 5205.
It allows DNS servers to store and return HIP resource records (RRs) with
a Host Identity (HI, the public component of the public-private key pair),
Host Identity Tag (HIT, a truncated hash of the public key), and an optional
number of Domain Names of rendezvous servers (RVSs).

The general steps are:

Apply the patch hip_55 to bind and build.

Compile hi2dns and generate HIP RRs using hi2dns.

Edit named.conf and the zone file adding the HIP RRs.

Start the named.

Use dig to check your RRs.

See INSTALL.BIND for building and installing bind.  See README.simple.example
for details of the other steps.  For more information, see the wiki page:
