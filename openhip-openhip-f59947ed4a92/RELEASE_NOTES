OpenHIP Release Notes

***** Version 0.9 March 2012 *****
The changes featured in the release are:
    * relicensed using the MIT Expat license instead of the GPLv2 license
    * enforce GNU coding style using uncrustify, include vim/emacs mode lines
    * reimplement mobile router using netfilter queue instead of libipq
    * removed GPLed header files and assembly language
    * removed outdated kernel support, libipsec, and i3 protocol code
    * removed PF_KEY thread, replacing with direct SADB calls
    * fix compilation under Ubuntu 11.10 and Fedora 15 (gcc 4.6.1/4.6.0)
    * added 'make check' target that launches automated testing using CORE
      (http://code.google.com/p/coreemu/)
    * implemented RFC 4303 ESP anti-replay protection with 64-bit ESN
    * implemented experimental multihoming triggered by lost ESP seq. numbers
    * added hip.conf options for ignored_address, save_my_identities
    * for HIP_VPLS/endbox mode pass layer-2 traffic: include ethernet headers
      in tunnel; use hello protocol for endbox multicast election; 
      allow default endbox for unresolvable legacy addresses
    * use pbuilder-dist and mock for building deb and RPM packages


***** Version 0.8 July 2011 *****
The changes featured in the release are:
    * numerous bugfixes since the 0.7 release (see the bug_tracker)
    * use IANA allocated HIP UDP port 10500 instead of 50500
    * contribution from Alexander Kiening: process RVS addresses from DNS
      response
    * improved mobile router to allow a mobile node behind one mobile router to
      connect to a mobile node behind another mobile router
    * support for mobile router double-jump
    * implement SA timeout, expiration
    * various endbox improvements
    * code to support OpenWRT compilation under ARM architecture
The deb files were built using Ubuntu 10.10, and the rpm files using Fedora 13.


***** Version 0.7 October 2009 *****
The big changes are:
    * HIP now operates over UDP by default, allowing you to initiate
      connections from behind a NAT
    * mobility handovers between IPv4 and IPv6 now possible in the mobile
      router mode
Here is a list of changes with greater detail:
    * changes from 0.7_RC1 to 0.7 include fixing a shutdown bug, mobility bug,
      secret key issue, and not sending locator parameters in R1 messages
      (unless --enable-mobile-router is used)
    * cleanup of the NAT code and implementation of the nat-08 draft for HIP/
      ESP over UDP that shares the same port 50500; removed all STUN code and
      options, now uses UDP by default for IPv4
    * cleanup command-line options
    * rewrite and cleanup of registration and rendezvous code in support of RFC
      5203 and RFC_5204
    * update to mobile router code to allow address family handovers when
      changing the MR's public address; cleanup of mobile router code, globals
      changed to static locals; support IPv4 in mobile router
    * update to --enable-sma-crawler=(config) option, files-based configuration
      library; now uses OpenSSL engine interface, removing OpenSC dependencies
    * restructure the HIP configuration library code to put common code in a
      base class
    * tested on Windows Vista, XP, Fedora 11, Ubuntu 9.04, CentOS 5.3, Mac OS X


***** Version 0.6 May 2009 *****
This is a maintenance release that fixes several bugs, and introduces the
following new code:
    * Boeing's Secure_Mobile_Architecture (SMA) implementation
    * Smartcard support with LDAP configuration API
    * Mobile router implementation of draft-melen-hip-mr-02.txt (Note: This is
      not an interoperable implementation with a draft-conformant
      implementation, but more of a demo-level implementation of the key
      features of HIP mobile router).
Note that instructions for building and configuring these new options are being
developed, check this wiki (Usage) for updated information.
