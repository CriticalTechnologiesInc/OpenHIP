Hello,

It's an honor to speak with you. Myself and my colleagues here at 
Critical Technologies Inc. (CTI) have consulted your book on HIP many 
times and its a pleasure to actually email you directly about the topic.

I originally got in contact with Tom Henderson about some questions I 
had with the current state of the OpenHIP project and what I have been 
up to (using HIP). He suggested I contact you and your students instead.

My direct question to you is this: I was wondering if there was a 
mailing list for OpenHIP or even HIP in general? My search turns up 
nothing on the main web pages. Tom has expressed that he would look into 
spinning up a Google Groups for HIP/OpenHIP to facilitate coordinated 
development and connect more people to the project. I told him I would 
get back to him once I had heard from you - being that you are more 
involved than he is.

My next question was related to OpenSSL. Tom had a precise answer for me 
however I will pass along that there is someone (Jeff Ahrenholz, 
Tempered Networks) that may be working on patching OpenHIP to work with 
OpenSSL 1.1 instead of 1.0.

I had run into various problems with this to the point I actually 
restarted from scratch. Myself and a co-worker ended up making changes 
to OpenHIP to compile but it had segfaults when running. I have offered 
Tom, and extend to you or anyone else, the patch files I made concerning 
our work. I found some rather interesting things about OpenSSL that I 
wish to consult with them about as we debugged the segfaults.

My final question to Tom was related to building OpenHIP using a 
different OpenSSL version. I have been trying (without much success) to 
run two different versions of OpenSSL on my system and point OpenHIP to 
the one I want. Is there a flag somewhere in the Makefiles to tell 
OpenHIP to use a specific binary or library for OpenSSL or its 
respective packages? My co-worker believes we should just have to change 
an environment variable to point to the correct versions location before 
running './configure' in the OpenHIP directory. I just wish to confirm 
with you that this would be the proper approach with OpenHIP.

The above question is somewhat superfluous as my co-worker got OpenHIP 
to statically build the binaries (on an older system) which were easily 
transferred over to our target platform. We documented this process and 
are willing to share this to anyone who is interested. We ended up 
compiling on Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS (with OpenSSL v1.0.1f) and moving it 
onto Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (with OpenSSL 1.1.0g). I have yet to fully test 
this setup but OpenHIP does finish starting up and sits idle waiting for 
HIP packets to appear. This is probably not optimal and if running two 
different OpenSSL's (or have the .so for the libraries) on the same box 
can be done I would like to use that instead.

Thanks for taking the time to read this email.
Hopefully this is the start of some collaboration on HIP together as CTI 
is very interested in it and its possible uses for many different projects.
