File Descriptors:

<host>-[hip,enp]-ping.[dump,log]
-- test with host sending pings

<host>-[hip,enp].[dump,log]
-- test with host recieving pings

PASS1 tests seem to be short. So I ran the test again (PASS2)
waiting for 30 seconds after the pings completed before killing the test.

Oddly there are still packets apparently missing/broken at 
the end of the test but I have enough data.
